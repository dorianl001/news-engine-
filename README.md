# Project Description: A short description of your game.

My Simon game will test your memory and reaction time by
making you repeat the sequence of colored buttons in a
timely manner. If you touch the wrong button or if you
take too long to press the right sequence, the game will
reset. Each round will progressively get faster as the
sequences become more difficult to remember and repeat.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.

## Technologies used

HTML5 was used to frame the website, CSS to style the website, and JavaScript for
all the interactive features.

# Project Issues

I had trouble randomizing my sequence to challenge the user

## Description

Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
at HTMLButtonElement.startFunc (demo3.js:58)

## Code Snippet

function startFunc(){
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
setTimeout( () => console.log("squareNumber", initialSeq[i]), i \* 3000)
}
console.log(initialSeq[i])
if(initialSeq[i] == 0){
setTimeout( () => {red.style.border = "thick solid #0000FF";}, 600)
setTimeout( () => {red.style.border = "none";}, 2000)
}else if(initialSeq[i] == 1){
setTimeout( () => {green.style.border = "thick solid #0000FF";}, 600)
setTimeout( () => {green.style.border = "none";}, 2000)
}}

## Your Error

I was trying to refactor my previous code to make it cleaner when my previous code was working.

## Why you think you're getting this error

I think I got the error from changing my code which made i the iterator have a null value.

## Everything you've tried

changing scope, re-arranging the order of the code, researching other methods, and console logging the results for more insight. After some guidance; the for loop logic was changed, added some variables on top of the loop, and made an adjustment to the setTimeOut interval.

## 1. Design

## 2. MVP Goals

- As a player, I want the game to start when I click the start button.
- As a player, I want to know if I chose the wrong button.
- As a player, I want the game to become increasingly difficult (speed and sequence)
- As a player, I want to know what round I am in.
- As a designer, I want the design to look pleasing to the eyes.

## 3. Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like to see a timer in order to know how much time I have to repeat a given sequence.
- As a player, I would like to hear metal music for the suspense and thrill aspect of the game.
- As a player, I would like to be allowed to repeat a sequence once per round.
